Unactionable feedback:

Addressed feedback:

  - Done Whitelist lift phantom
  - Put plot items in the bridge
  - No large furniture
  - Three variations of "random": "Mostly sane" (items will be swapped for an item of the same type), "Crazy but not game breaking" (avoid spawning items that will wreck the game), and "Just fuck my shit up"
  - Remove large tentacles
  - Double check the spawn point defs (throw exception if spawn def is null)
  - Do not spawn cystoid nests (super annoying)
  - Shuttle bay <--> GUTS keycard?
