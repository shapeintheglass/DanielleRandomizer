General plan


v1 - Support spawn randomization, cosmetic randomization
v2 - Support station randomization, snark premade, bad translation premade


Current known issues:
 - Item shuffler has some bugs- blacklist doesn't appear to ignore keycards
 - Item shuffler does not handle npc spawns
 - Allow item shuffler to distinguish between physics props and immovable objects
 - Need support to coordinate changes across multiple files

Presets:
	Recommended - Randomizes items, enemies, neuromod tree, operator dispensers
	Unpreyable - Nightmares added to pool, weapons removed from pool, limited to starting weapons in Morgan's apartment
	Meme - Whiskey and cigars, wrench only, default randomizers
